			People who find you online want to know about your company’s mission, vision, and, of course, how you can help them solve their problems. And, an impactful and memorable first impression can help you stand out in the digital world.
			How can you make sure that they have all that information at their fingertips? Well, a company profile is the perfect tool for the job.
			You can justify a higher price point for your products and services, if you go into details about your production values or ethically-sourced materials.
			For instance, Starbucks’ coffee may not necessarily be better than Dunkin’ Donuts’ coffee, but because Starbucks goes into details about its high-quality ingredients, it immediately creates the sense that you’ll be paying a little more for a "better" product.
